For all designs I ask you to make, have them be visually stunning, unique, and worthy of a real-world, production-level website. Avoid anything that looks like a generic template.

ðŸ“Œ TECHNOLOGY & STYLING
- Use JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes.
- Use shadcn/ui for UI components.
- Use Lucide React for icons (logo, buttons, navigation icons).
- Do not install or use other UI theme libraries, icon sets, or design frameworks unless I explicitly request it.
- Use stock photos from Unsplash where appropriate.
- Ensure responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Prioritize accessibility (ARIA attributes, proper semantic HTML).
- All text should be in English with a professional, business-focused tone.

ðŸ“Œ DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- Sleek, modern, minimal but impactful.
- Grid-based layouts for structure and clarity.
- 2XL rounded corners, soft shadows, and balanced white space.
- Typography hierarchy: large headlines (xlâ€“3xl), readable body text, consistent font weights.
- Use a consistent color palette inspired by EranFixer brand identity (deep blues, silver/grey tones, subtle gradients).
- Avoid clutter; every element should have a clear purpose.
